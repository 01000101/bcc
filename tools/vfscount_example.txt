Demonstrations of vfscount, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This counts VFS calls, by tracing various kernel calls beginning with "vfs_"
(edit the script to customize):

# ./vfscount 
Tracing... Ctrl-C to end.
^C
ADDR             FUNC            COUNT
ffffffff811f2cc1 vfs_create         24
ffffffff811e71c1 vfs_write         203
ffffffff811e6061 vfs_open          765
ffffffff811e7091 vfs_read         1852

This can be useful for workload characterization, to see what types of
operations are in use.
