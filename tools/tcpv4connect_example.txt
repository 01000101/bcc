Demonstrations of tcpv4connect, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This tool traces the kernel function performing active TCP IPv4 connections
(eg, via a connect() syscall; accept() are passive connections). Some example
output (IP addresses changed to protect the innocent):

# ./tcpv4connect 
PID    COMM         SADDR            DADDR            DPORT
1479   telnet       127.0.0.1        127.0.0.1        23  
1469   curl         10.201.219.236   54.245.105.25    80  
1469   curl         10.201.219.236   54.67.101.145    80  

This output shows three connections, one from a "telnet" process and two from
"curl". The output details shows the source address, destination address,
and destination port. This traces attempted connections: these may have failed.

The overhead of this tool should be negligible, since it is only tracing the
kernel function performing a connect. It is not tracing every packet and then
filtering.


The -t option prints a timestamp column:

# ./tcpv4connect -t
TIME(s)  PID    COMM         SADDR            DADDR            DPORT
31.871   2482   local_agent  10.103.219.236   10.251.148.38    7001
31.874   2482   local_agent  10.103.219.236   10.101.3.132     7001
31.878   2482   local_agent  10.103.219.236   10.171.133.98    7101
90.917   2482   local_agent  10.103.219.236   10.251.148.38    7001
90.928   2482   local_agent  10.103.219.236   10.102.64.230    7001
90.938   2482   local_agent  10.103.219.236   10.115.167.169   7101

The output shows some periodic connections (or attempts) from a "local_agent"
process to various other addresses. A few connections occur every minute.


USAGE message:

# ./tcpv4connect -h
usage: tcpv4connect [-h] [-t] [-p PID]

Trace TCP IPv4 connects

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -t, --timestamp    include timestamp on output
  -p PID, --pid PID  trace this PID only

examples:
    ./tcpv4connect           # trace all open() syscalls
    ./tcpv4connect -t        # include timestamps
    ./tcpv4connect -p 181    # only trace PID 181
