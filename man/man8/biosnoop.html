<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

biosnoop - Trace block device I/O and print details incl. issuing PID.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>biosnoop [-hQ]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This tools traces block device I/O (disk I/O), and prints a one-line summary
for each I/O showing various details. These include the latency from the time of
issue to the device to its completion, and the PID and process name from when
the I/O was first created (which usually identifies the responsible process).
<P>
This uses in-kernel eBPF maps to cache process details (PID and comm) by I/O
request, as well as a starting timestamp for calculating I/O latency.
<P>
This works by tracing various kernel blk_*() functions using dynamic tracing,
and will need updating to match any changes to these functions.
<P>
This makes use of a Linux 4.4 feature (bpf_perf_event_output());
for kernels older than 4.4, see the version under tools/old,
which uses an older mechanism
<P>
Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REQUIREMENTS</H2>

CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-h<DD>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FIELDS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>TIME(s)<DD>
Time of the I/O completion, in seconds since the first I/O was seen.
<DT>COMM<DD>
Cached process name, if present. This usually (but isn't guaranteed) to identify
the responsible process for the I/O.
<DT>PID<DD>
Cached process ID, if present. This usually (but isn't guaranteed) to identify
the responsible process for the I/O.
<DT>DISK<DD>
Disk device name.
<DT>T<DD>
Type of I/O: R = read, W = write. This is a simplification.
<DT>SECTOR<DD>
Device sector for the I/O.
<DT>BYTES<DD>
Size of the I/O, in bytes.
<DT>QUE(ms)<DD>
Time the I/O was queued in the OS before being issued to the device,
in milliseconds.
<DT>LAT(ms)<DD>
Time for the I/O (latency) from the issue to the device, to its completion,
in milliseconds.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OVERHEAD</H2>

Since block device I/O usually has a relatively low frequency (&lt; 10,000/s),
the overhead for this tool is expected to be negligible. For high IOPS storage
systems, test and quantify before use.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SOURCE</H2>

This is from bcc.

example usage, output, and commentary for this tool.
