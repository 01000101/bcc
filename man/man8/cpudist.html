<H2>NAME</H2>

cpudist - On- and off-CPU task time as a histogram.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>cpudist [-h] [-O] [-T] [-m] [-P] [-L] [-p PID] [interval] [count]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This measures the time a task spends on the CPU before being descheduled, and
shows the times as a histogram. Tasks that spend a very short time on the CPU
can be indicative of excessive context-switches and poor workload distribution,
and possibly point to a shared source of contention that keeps tasks switching
in and out as it becomes available (such as a mutex).
<P>
Similarly, the tool can also measure the time a task spends off-CPU before it
is scheduled again. This can be helpful in identifying long blocking and I/O
operations, or alternatively very short descheduling times due to short-lived
locks or timers.
<P>
This tool uses in-kernel eBPF maps for storing timestamps and the histogram,
for efficiency. Despite this, the overhead of this tool may become significant
for some workloads: see the OVERHEAD section.
<P>
Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-h<DD>
Print usage message.

<DT>-T<DD>
Include timestamps on output.
<DT>-m<DD>
Output histogram in milliseconds.
<DT>-P<DD>
Print a histogram for each PID (tgid from the kernel's perspective).
<DT>-L<DD>
Print a histogram for each TID (pid from the kernel's perspective).
<DT>-p PID<DD>
Only show this PID (filtered in kernel for efficiency).
<DT>interval<DD>
Output interval, in seconds.
<DT>count<DD>
Number of outputs.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FIELDS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>usecs<DD>
Microsecond range
<DT>msecs<DD>
Millisecond range
<DT>count<DD>
How many times a task event fell into this range
<DT>distribution<DD>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OVERHEAD</H2>

This traces scheduler tracepoints, which can become very frequent. While eBPF
has very low overhead, and this tool uses in-kernel maps for efficiency, the
frequency of scheduler events for some workloads may be high enough that the
overhead of this tool becomes significant. Measure in a lab environment
to quantify the overhead before use.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SOURCE</H2>
