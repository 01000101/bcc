<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

compactstall - Trace compact zone events. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>compactsnoop.py [-h] [-T] [-p PID] [-d DURATION] [-K] [-e]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

compactsnoop traces the compact zone events, showing which processes are
allocing pages with memory compaction. This can be useful for discovering
when compact_stall (/proc/vmstat) continues to increase, whether it is
caused by some critical processes or not.
<P>
This works by tracing the compact zone events using raw_tracepoints and one
kretprobe.
<P>
For the Centos 7.6 (3.10.x kernel), see the version under tools/old, which 
uses an older memory compaction mechanism.
<P>
Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REQUIREMENTS</H2>

CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-h<DD>
Print usage message.
<DT>-T<DD>
Include a timestamp column.
<DT>-p PID<DD>
Trace this process ID only (filtered in-kernel).
<DT>-d DURATION<DD>
Total duration of trace in seconds.
<DT>-K<DD>
Output kernel stack trace
<DT>-e<DD>
Show extended fields.
</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Trace all compact zone events:<DD>
#
<B>compactsnoop</B>

<DT>Trace all compact zone events, for 10 seconds only:<DD>
#
<B>compactsnoop -d 10</B>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FIELDS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>TIME(s)<DD>
Time of the call, in seconds.
<DT>COMM<DD>
Process name
<DT>PID<DD>
Process ID
<DT>NODE<DD>
Memory node
<DT>ZONE<DD>
Zone of the node (such as DMA, DMA32, NORMAL eg)
<DT>ORDER<DD>
Shows which order alloc cause memory compaction, -1 means all orders (eg: write
to /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory)
<DT>MODE<DD>
SYNC OR ASYNC
<DT>FRAGIDX (extra column)<DD>
The FRAGIDX is short for fragmentation index, which only makes sense if an
allocation of a requested size would fail. If that is true, the fragmentation
index indicates whether external fragmentation or a lack of memory was the
problem. The value can be used to determine if page reclaim or compaction
should be used.
</DL>
<P>


Index is between 0 and 1 so return within 3 decimal places
<P>


0 =&gt; allocation would fail due to lack of memory
<P>


1 =&gt; allocation would fail due to fragmentation
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>MIN (extra column)<DD>
The min watermark of the zone
<DT>LOW (extra column)<DD>
The low watermark of the zone
<DT>HIGH (extra column)<DD>
The high watermark of the zone
<DT>FREE (extra column)<DD>
The nr_free_pages of the zone
<DT>LAT(ms)<DD>
compact zone's latency
<DT>STATUS<DD>
The compaction's result.
</DL>
<P>


For (CentOS 7.6's kernel), the status include:
<P>


&quot;skipped&quot; (COMPACT_SKIPPED): compaction didn't start as it was not possible or 
direct reclaim was more suitable
<P>


&quot;continue&quot; (COMPACT_CONTINUE): compaction should continue to another pageblock
<P>


&quot;partial&quot; (COMPACT_PARTIAL): direct compaction partially compacted a zone and 
there are suitable pages
<P>


&quot;complete&quot; (COMPACT_COMPLETE): The full zone was compacted
<P>


For (kernel 4.7 and above):
<P>


&quot;not_suitable_zone&quot; (COMPACT_NOT_SUITABLE_ZONE): For more detailed tracepoint 
output - internal to compaction
<P>


&quot;skipped&quot; (COMPACT_SKIPPED): compaction didn't start as it was not possible or 
direct reclaim was more suitable
<P>


&quot;deferred&quot; (COMPACT_DEFERRED): compaction didn't start as it was deferred due 
to past failures
<P>


&quot;no_suitable_page&quot; (COMPACT_NOT_SUITABLE_PAGE): For more detailed tracepoint 
output - internal to compaction
<P>


&quot;continue&quot; (COMPACT_CONTINUE): compaction should continue to another pageblock
<P>


&quot;complete&quot; (COMPACT_COMPLETE): The full zone was compacted scanned but wasn't
successful to compact suitable pages.
<P>


&quot;partial_skipped&quot; (COMPACT_PARTIAL_SKIPPED): direct compaction has scanned part
of the zone but wasn't successful to compact suitable pages.
<P>


&quot;contended&quot; (COMPACT_CONTENDED): compaction terminated prematurely due to lock
contentions
<P>


&quot;success&quot; (COMPACT_SUCCESS): direct compaction terminated after concluding that 
the allocation should now succeed
<P>


<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OVERHEAD</H2>

This traces the kernel compact zone kprobe/kretprobe or raw_tracepoints and
prints output for each event. As the rate of this is generally expected to be
low (&lt; 1000/s), the overhead is also expected to be negligible.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SOURCE</H2>
