.TH vfscount 8  "2015-08-18" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
vfscount \- Count some common VFS calls. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vfscount
.SH DESCRIPTION
This counts common VFS calls. This can be useful for general workload
characterization of these operations.

This works by tracing some kernel vfs functions using dynamic tracing, and will
need updating to match any changes to these functions. Edit the script to
customize and add functions to trace, which is easy to do.

Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Count some VFS calls until Ctrl-C is hit:
#
.B vfscount
.SH FIELDS
.TP
ADDR
Address of the instruction pointer that was traced (only useful if the FUNC column is suspicious and you would like to double check the translation).
.TP
FUNC
Kernel function name
.TP
COUNT
Number of calls while tracing
.SH OVERHEAD
This traces various kernel vfs functions and maintains in-kernel counts, which
are asynchronously copied to user-space. While the rate of VFS operations can
be very high (>1M/sec), this is a relatively efficient way to trace these
events, and so the overhead is expected to be small for normal workloads.
Measure in a test environment.
