<H2>NAME</H2>

offwaketime - Summarize blocked time by off-CPU stack + waker stack. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>offwaketime [-h] [-p PID | -t TID | -u | -k] [-U | -K] [-f] [--stack-storage-size STACK_STORAGE_SIZE] [-m MIN_BLOCK_TIME] [-M MAX_BLOCK_TIME] [duration]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program shows kernel stack traces and task names that were blocked and
&quot;off-CPU&quot;, along with the stack traces and task names for the threads that woke
them, and the total elapsed time from when they blocked to when they were woken
up.  This combines the summaries from both the offcputime and wakeuptime tools.
The time measurement will be very similar to off-CPU time, however, off-CPU time
may include a little extra time spent waiting on a run queue to be scheduled.
The combined stacks, task names, and total time is summarized in kernel context
for efficiency, using an eBPF map.
<P>
The output summary will further help you identify reasons why threads
were blocking, and quantify the time from when they were blocked to woken up.
This spans all types of blocking activity: disk I/O, network I/O, locks, page
faults, swapping, sleeping, involuntary context switches, etc.
<P>
This is complementary to CPU profiling (e.g., CPU flame graphs) which shows
the time spent on-CPU. This shows the time spent blocked off-CPU, and the
output, especially the -f format, can be used to generate an &quot;off-wake time
flame graph&quot;.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OVERHEAD</H2>

This summarizes unique stack trace pairs in-kernel for efficiency, allowing it
to trace a higher rate of events than methods that post-process in user space.
The stack trace and time data is only copied to user space once, when the output
is printed. While these techniques greatly lower overhead, scheduler events are
still a high frequency event, as they can exceed 1 million events per second,
and so caution should still be used. Test before production use.
<P>
If the overhead is still a problem, take a look at the min block option.
If your aim is to chase down longer blocking events, then this could
be increased to filter shorter blocking events, further lowering overhead.
