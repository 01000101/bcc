<H2>NAME</H2>

memleak - Print a summary of outstanding allocations and their call stacks to detect memory leaks. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>memleak [-h] [-p PID] [-t] [-a] [-o OLDER] [-c COMMAND] [--combined-only]</B>

[-s SAMPLE_RATE] [-T TOP] [-z MIN_SIZE] [-Z MAX_SIZE] [-O OBJ] [INTERVAL]
[COUNT]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

memleak traces and matches memory allocation and deallocation requests, and
collects call stacks for each allocation. memleak can then print a summary
of which call stacks performed allocations that weren't subsequently freed.
<P>
When tracing a specific process, memleak instruments a list of allocation
functions from libc, specifically: malloc, calloc, realloc, posix_memalign,
valloc, memalign, pvalloc, aligned_alloc, and free.
When tracing all processes, memleak instruments kmalloc/kfree,
kmem_cache_alloc/kmem_cache_free, and also page allocations made by
get_free_pages/free_pages.
<P>
memleak may introduce significant overhead when tracing processes that allocate
and free many blocks very quickly. See the OVERHEAD section below.
<P>
This tool only works on Linux 4.6+. Stack traces are obtained using the new BPF_STACK_TRACE` APIs.
For kernels older than 4.6, see the version under tools/old.
Kernel memory allocations are intercepted through tracepoints, which are
available on Linux 4.7+.

<H2>REQUIREMENTS</H2>

CONFIG_BPF and bcc.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-h<DD>
Print usage message.
<DT>-p PID<DD>
Trace this process ID only (filtered in-kernel). This traces libc allocator.
<DT>-t<DD>
Print a trace of all allocation and free requests and results.
<DT>-a<DD>
Print a list of allocations that weren't freed (and their sizes) in addition to their call stacks.
<DT>-o OLDER<DD>
Print only allocations older than OLDER milliseconds. Useful to remove false positives.
The default value is 500 milliseconds.
<DT>-c COMMAND<DD>
Run the specified command and trace its allocations only. This traces libc allocator.
<DT>--combined-only<DD>
Use statistics precalculated in kernel space. Amount of data to be pulled from
kernel significantly decreases, at the cost of losing capabilities of time-based
false positives filtering (-o).
<DT>-s SAMPLE_RATE<DD>
Record roughly every SAMPLE_RATE-th allocation to reduce overhead.
<DT>-t TOP<DD>
Print only the top TOP stacks (sorted by size).
The default value is 10.
<DT>-z MIN_SIZE<DD>
Capture only allocations that are larger than or equal to MIN_SIZE bytes.
<DT>-Z MAX_SIZE<DD>
Capture only allocations that are smaller than or equal to MAX_SIZE bytes.
<DT>-O OBJ<DD>
Attach to allocation functions in specified object instead of resolving libc. Ignored when kernel allocations are profiled.
<DT>INTERVAL<DD>
Print a summary of outstanding allocations and their call stacks every INTERVAL seconds.
The default interval is 5 seconds.
<DT>COUNT<DD>
Print the outstanding allocations summary COUNT times and then exit.
</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Print outstanding kernel allocation stacks every 3 seconds:<DD>
#
<B>memleak 3</B>

<DT>Print user outstanding allocation stacks and allocation details for the process 1005:<DD>
#
<B>memleak -p 1005 -a</B>

<DT>Sample roughly every 5th allocation (~20%) of the call stacks and print the top 5<DD>
stacks 10 times before quitting.
#
<B>memleak -s 5 --top=5 10</B>

<DT>Run ./allocs and print outstanding allocation stacks for that process: <DD>
#
<B>memleak -c ./allocs</B>

<DT>Capture only allocations between 16 and 32 bytes in size:<DD>
#
<B>memleak -z 16 -Z 32</B>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OVERHEAD</H2>

memleak can have significant overhead if the target process or kernel performs
allocations at a very high rate. Pathological cases may exhibit up to 100x
degradation in running time. Most of the time, however, memleak shouldn't cause
a significant slowdown. You can use the -s switch to reduce the overhead
further by capturing only every N-th allocation. The -z and -Z switches can
also reduce overhead by capturing only allocations of specific sizes.
<P>
Additionally, option --combined-only saves processing time by reusing already
calculated allocation statistics from kernel. It's faster, but lacks information
about particular allocations.
<P>
To determine the rate at which your application is calling malloc/free, or the
rate at which your kernel is calling kmalloc/kfree, place a probe with perf and
collect statistics. For example, to determine how many calls to __kmalloc are
placed in a typical period of 10 seconds:
<P>
#
<B>perf probe '__kmalloc'</B>

<P>
#
<B>perf stat -a -e 'probe:__kmalloc' -- sleep 10</B>
