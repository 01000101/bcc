<H2>NAME</H2>

wakeuptime - Summarize sleep to wakeup time by waker kernel stack. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>wakeuptime [-h] [-u] [-p PID] [-v] [-f] [--stack-storage-size STACK_STORAGE_SIZE] [-m MIN_BLOCK_TIME] [-M MAX_BLOCK_TIME] [duration]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program shows the kernel stack traces for threads that woke up other 
blocked threads, along with the process names of the waker and target, along
with a sum of the time that the target was blocked: the &quot;blocked time&quot;.
It works by tracing when threads block and when they were then woken up, and
measuring the time delta. This time measurement will be very similar to off-CPU
time, however, off-CPU time may include a little extra time spent waiting
on a run queue to be scheduled. The stack traces, process names, and time spent
blocked is summarized in the kernel using an eBPF map for efficiency.
<P>
The output summary will help you identify reasons why threads
were blocking by showing who woke them up, along with the time they were
blocked. This spans all types of blocking activity: disk I/O, network I/O,
locks, page faults, involuntary context switches, etc.
<P>
This can be used in conjunction with offcputime, which shows the stack trace
of the blocked thread. wakeuptime shows the stack trace of the waker thread.

<P>
This tool only works on Linux 4.6+. It uses the new `BPF_STACK_TRACE` table
APIs to generate the in-kernel stack traces.

<H2>OVERHEAD</H2>

This summarizes unique stack traces in-kernel for efficiency, allowing it to
trace a higher rate of events than methods that post-process in user space. The
stack trace and time data is only copied to user space once, when the output is
printed. While these techniques greatly lower overhead, scheduler events are
still a high frequency event, as they can exceed 1 million events per second,
and so caution should still be used. Test before production use.
<P>
If the overhead is still a problem, take a look at the min block option.
If your aim is to chase down longer blocking events, then this could
be increased to filter shorter blocking events, further lowering overhead.
