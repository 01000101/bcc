<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

runqslower - Trace long process scheduling delays.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>runqslower [-p PID] [-t TID] [min_us]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This measures the time a task spends waiting on a run queue (or equivalent
scheduler data structure) for a turn on-CPU, and shows occurrences of time
exceeding passed threshold. This time should be small, but a task may need
to wait its turn due to CPU load. The higher the CPU load, the longer a task
will generally need to wait its turn.
<P>
This tool measures two types of run queue latency:
<P>
1. The time from a task being enqueued on a run queue to its context switch
and execution. This traces ttwu_do_wakeup(), wake_up_new_task() -&gt;
finish_task_switch() with either raw tracepoints (if supported) or kprobes
and instruments the run queue latency after a voluntary context switch.
<P>
2. The time from when a task was involuntary context switched and still
in the runnable state, to when it next executed. This is instrumented
from finish_task_switch() alone.
<P>
The overhead of this tool may become significant for some workloads:
see the OVERHEAD section.
<P>
This works by tracing various kernel scheduler functions using dynamic tracing,
and will need updating to match any changes to these functions.
<P>
Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REQUIREMENTS</H2>

CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-h<DD>
Print usage message.
<DT>-p PID<DD>
Only show this PID (filtered in kernel for efficiency).
<DT>-t TID<DD>
Only show this TID (filtered in kernel for efficiency).
<DT>min_us<DD>
Minimum scheduling delay in microseconds to output.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Show scheduling delays longer than 10ms:<DD>
#
<B>runqslower</B>

<DT>Show scheduling delays longer than 1ms for process with PID 123:<DD>
#
<B>runqslower -p 123 1000</B>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FIELDS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>TIME<DD>
Time of when scheduling event occurred.
<DT>COMM<DD>
Process name.
<DT>PID<DD>
Process ID.
<DT>LAT(us)<DD>
Scheduling latency from time when task was ready to run to the time it was
assigned to a CPU to run.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OVERHEAD</H2>

This traces scheduler functions, which can become very frequent. While eBPF
has very low overhead, and this tool uses in-kernel maps for efficiency, the
frequency of scheduler events for some workloads may be high enough that the
overhead of this tool becomes significant. Measure in a lab environment
to quantify the overhead before use.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SOURCE</H2>

This is from bcc.
