<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

btrfsslower - Trace slow btrfs file operations, with per-event details.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>btrfsslower [-h] [-j] [-p PID] [min_ms] [-d DURATION]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This tool traces common btrfs file operations: reads, writes, opens, and
syncs. It measures the time spent in these operations, and prints details
for each that exceeded a threshold.
<P>
WARNING: See the OVERHEAD section.
<P>
By default, a minimum millisecond threshold of 10 is used. If a threshold of 0
is used, all events are printed (warning: verbose).
<P>
Since this works by tracing the btrfs_file_operations interface functions, it
will need updating to match any changes to these functions.
<P>
Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REQUIREMENTS</H2>

CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

-p PID
Trace this PID only.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>min_ms<DD>
Minimum I/O latency (duration) to trace, in milliseconds. Default is 10 ms.
<DT>-d DURATION<DD>
Total duration of trace in seconds.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FIELDS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>TIME(s)<DD>
Time of I/O completion since the first I/O seen, in seconds.
<DT>COMM<DD>
Process name.
<DT>PID<DD>
Process ID.
<DT>T<DD>
Type of operation. R == read, W == write, O == open, S == fsync.
<DT>OFF_KB<DD>
File offset for the I/O, in Kbytes.
<DT>BYTES<DD>
Size of I/O, in bytes.
<DT>LAT(ms)<DD>
Latency (duration) of I/O, measured from when it was issued by VFS to the
filesystem, to when it completed. This time is inclusive of block device I/O,
file system CPU cycles, file system locks, run queue latency, etc. It's a more
accurate measure of the latency suffered by applications performing file
system I/O, than to measure this down at the block device interface.
<DT>FILENAME<DD>
A cached kernel file name (comes from dentry-&gt;d_name.name).
<DT>ENDTIME_us<DD>
Completion timestamp, microseconds (-j only).
<DT>OFFSET_b<DD>
File offset, bytes (-j only).
<DT>LATENCY_us<DD>
Latency (duration) of the I/O, in microseconds (-j only).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OVERHEAD</H2>

This adds low-overhead instrumentation to btrfs writes and fsyncs, as well
as all system reads and opens (due to the current implementation of the
btrfs_file_operations interface). Particularly, all reads and writes from
the file system cache will incur extra overhead while tracing. Such reads and
writes can be very frequent (depending on the workload; eg, 1M/sec), at which
point the overhead of this tool may become noticeable.
Measure and quantify before use. If this
continues to be a problem, consider switching to a tool that prints in-kernel
summaries only, such as <A HREF="https://iovisor.github.io/bcc?8+btrfsdist">btrfsdist</A>(8).
<P>

Note that the overhead of this tool should be less than <A HREF="https://iovisor.github.io/bcc?8+fileslower">fileslower</A>(8), as
this tool targets btrfs functions only, and not all file read/write paths
(which can include socket I/O).
